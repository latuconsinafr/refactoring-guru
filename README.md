## When to refactor

1. When you’re doing something for the first time, just get it done.
2. When you’re doing something similar for the second time, cringe at having to repeat but do the same thing anyway.
3. When you’re doing something for the third time, start refactoring.
4. When adding a feature.
5. When fixing a bug.
6. During a code review.

## How to refactor

1. The code should become cleaner, focus on refactoring with small changes.
2. New functionality shouldn't be created during refactoring.
3. All existing tests must pass after refactoring.
4. When you’re doing something for the third time, start refactoring.
5. When adding a feature.
